# design notes: 1. it seems logical to have the prompt-key tied to the button
#         on the button, instead of having to infer it from the DB
#         2. when the button is activated and we enter text-provocation-mode,
#         then these words need to fill somehwere up. I think that could also be an object
#         with an area/shape, and that object should belinked here to the button then...
#         (or some other way for code ot know where to spawn new words then)
